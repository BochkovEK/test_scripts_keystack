[VMs with volumes by index]
This example includes only one main.tf config and does not accept any variables.
For flexible resource creation, it is recommended to use ~test_scripts_keystack/terraform/examples/create_vms_with_module/

This set of configs for terraform creates:
    - VM
        - count
        - volume by image
        - port by network
        - volumes by index
