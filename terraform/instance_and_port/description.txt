This set of configs for terraform creates a sequence of VMs and ports.
In the variables.tf file you must specify the 'qty' (VMs) and 'fixed_ip_pattren'.

qty = 9
fixed_ip_pattren = "10.224.129.23"

Terraform will create a follow that looks like:

TEST_VM-1	10.224.129.231
TEST_VM-2	10.224.129.232
...
TEST_VM-9	10.224.129.239
